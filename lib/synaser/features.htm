<LI>SynaSer is not components, but only classes and routines. Not needed any installation.
<LI>Working under Delphi, C++Builder, Kylix or FreePascal.
<LI>Supported platforms are Win32 and Linux.
<LI>Support for communicating on serial ports in blocking (synchronous) mode.
<LI>Supported is high speed of communication. (about few megabytes per second!).
<LI>Consume very low CPU time.
<LI>Supported is same communication mechanism as used in Synapse TCP/IP library.
<LI>Can lock serial port under Linux (like Windows do it).
<LI>Support for software and hardware handshake. 
<LI>You may open any COM port, if exists in you system (i.e. COM156). You can use Windows or Linux naming of devices on any supported platform!
<LI>Support for half-duplex RTS driven communication on all supported systems, include linux, WinNT or Win9x! (good for RS485 convertors, etc.)
<LI>Option for detect device presence before each data transmission.
<LI>Support for easy use of AT commands for communicate with modems.
